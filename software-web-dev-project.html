            </section>
            <section>
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>In this section of the report, 3 websites which were picked under the same problem description that was stated in the previous section will be analysed. For each of the website, the site layout and site content will be analysed. The analysis will then be used to advise the layout of the website that will be built.</p>
            <p>The first website that will be analysed is http://riccardozanutta.com/ which is a portfolio website for Riccardo Zanutta who is a freelance front-end developer. The website layout has a single column layout where the content is laid out one after another vertically, the user is greeted with a full-page header section and the navigation is located at the top. </p>
            <p>Content wise, the three main topics on the website which are “Case Studies” where it contains his recent works, “Experiments”, “Contacts” and “About me” are all kept on the homepage and clicking on the navigation either scrolls the page down to the content or pops up content. In the “Case Studies” section, the user is greeted with several cards which can be clicked on. Clicking on these cards direct the user to a new page which contain details of one of his works</p>
            <p>The second website is https://prashantsani.com/ which is a portfolio website for Prashant Sani who is a front-end web developer. The website uses a mobile first with a single column layout. The site navigation is opened by a button and a full-page navigation appears. </p>
            <p>The website contains all its content on the homepage, the site has topics such as “Projects” where all their work is listed and clicking on them directs the user to a page describing the details of one of their work, “About” where they give a brief description of themselves and they include a link to their CV, “Training” where they describe their service in training individuals, “Experiments” where they showcase their CodePens and “Contact” which allow the user to send Prashant an email.</p>
            <p>The third website is https://www.henry-tieu.com which is a portfolio website for Henry Tieu who is an Adventure Elopement and Intimate Wedding photographer. The layout of the website on large screens consists of many layout types, the user is first greeted with a hero image, then the rest of the website consists of split layout where there is text content on one side and an image on the other side, a single column layout or grid layout for their articles.</p>
            <p>The website contains content over several pages, a navigation bar at the top of the page allows the users to access the different pages. The homepage contains a link to the contacts page, a taster on what an elopement is, an introduction to the photographers, links to different blogs and pictures showing their work throughout the page. The website contains categories of pages such as “Elopement Experience”, “Info” such as “About us”, “FAQs”, etc…, “Blogs”, “Pricing”, “For Photographers” which has pages of resources which help educate and enable other photographers to get a start in elopement photography, and the “Contacts” page where users can send in enquiries or bookings.</p>
